			<h3 class="text-warning" >Plot Synopsis:</h3>
			<p align="center"> In a world where superheroes are owned by evil, money hungry, faceless corporations who care nothing but to acquire money, the common people suffer. While the superheroes are idolized as saviors for America, in truth they cause more harm than good and often get innocents killed with little to no consequences. THe protaginist Hughie, has his girlfriend killed due to this universe's version of The Flash and wants any revenge he can get. He meets Billy Butcher, a somewhat psychopathic vigilante who has made it his life's goal to kill every last one of the so called heroes for what one did to his wife.</p>

			<h3 class="text-success">Homelander</h3>
			<p>The Superman stand-in and by far the most iconic and beloved character of the show, despite being the most evil.
